Release 0.1.4

        Hi. In this release I bring new exception to you. Yeah, we all like exceptions... 
    This one prevents saving unsaved changes and is named: UnsavedChangesError. 
    I know you will like it.
        Also, improvements in store method and it's submethods. As a bonus I saved a few 
    lines with it.
        Something more? Hardly anything except for some minor refactoring. 
        This release also aims at making pyproperties more compatible with specification of 
    a property file format at Oracle's Docs (it is described on the Oracle website:
    http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html )

        I feel sorry for disappointing you. I had many things to do for school this week.


    Post scriptum.

        Could you do one thing for me? It will not take you more than a cpule of minutes. 
    I would be glad if you could send me an email briefly saying for what things do you use 
    pyproperties.
        If you do not want me to reply add '--no-reply' option to the subject. 
        My email is in README file, but if you do not have it accidentally opened here it is:
    triviuss [at] gmail [dot] com

        Thanks.

    This release brings you:
    *   a update(s),
    *   b fix(es),
    *   c new feature(s).

    ->  pyproperties.py
        *   upd:    white space preceding property value is ignored,
        *   upd:    lines starting with '!' are also considered comments 
                    this is done so for compatibility, comments added by pyproperties are written 
                    always as '# comment'; I discourage you to use '!' for commenting,
        *   upd:    store method now operates on instance variables not a method local variables.
        *   upd:    _storegroups and _storesrc do not return anything. They change instance 
                    variables instead.
        *   upd:    _groupstore renamed to _storegroups and _srcstore renamed to _storesrc,
                    this will not affect your usage because these are mothods used internaly,
        *   fix:    preventing unsing store when unsaved changes are present.
        *   new:    UnsavedChangesError exception,
        *   new:    _appendsrc() method for effective joining two sources,
                    it prevents errors when join() was used with prefix and gives more control 
                    over our properties,


    Yours,
    Marek Marecki.
