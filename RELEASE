#### Release 0.1.5

>       This release brings new submethod which runs during store(). It is called _dump().
>   While it is yet-another-one submethod in store() it gives programmer even greter control
>   over the process of writing properties to file. By passing 'no_dump' argument as True to
>   store() method you can tell it to only generate lines and use your custom function to write 
>   them to file.
