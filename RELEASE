Release 0.1.1

    I had some problems with a git repository on SourceForge. 
    So I decided to throw everything away and start once again. 

    ->  pyproperties.py
        *   fix:    reload() method does not longer crash,
        *   upd:    join() now takes (path, prefix, merge) as arguments; 
                    refer to DOC for more information,
        *   new:    melt() method, as an argument takes another properties object,
                    it's very similar method to join() but takes works with already loaded 
                    properties; please refer to DOC for more information
        *   upd:    reload() works in new way,
        *   upd:    refresh() works in new way,
        *   new:    save() - saves changes made to properties dict,
        *   upd:    store() - uses propsorigin dict when looking for properites to write,
        *   new:    propsorigin variable of dict() type,
                    it stores secured version of properties;


    As usual, I did not manage to list all of changes and updates here. 
Some of them are quite drastic (but it's prealpha software after all, so I feel excused) so 
it would be better for you if you check your software for conflicts with the new version. 
    Now, when I'm heading for version 0.1.2 it's time to define a stable, final API. 
This is one of the reasons for such dramiatical changes in some the way some methods work - I 
just want an API which is (quite) intuitive and easy to learn and remember. 
    So I wrote several snippets and found that some of my design choices were not so good and 
changed them - when it is not so painful.

Yours,
