Release 0.1.1

    I had some problems with a git repository on SourceForge. 
    So I decided to throw everything away and start once again. 

    ->  pyproperties.py
        *   fix:    reload() method does not longer crash,
        *   upd:    join() now takes (path, prefix, merge) as arguments; 
                    refer to DOC for more information,
        *   new:    melt() method, as an argument takes another properties object,
                    it's very similar method to join() but takes works with already loaded 
                    properties; please refer to DOC for more information
        *   upd:    reload() works in new way,
        *   upd:    refresh()
