Release 0.1.2

        This release brings you:
    *   4 update(s),
    *   2 fix(es),
    *   3 new feature(s).

    ->  pyproperties.py
        *   upd:    join() behaves diffrently, read DOC for more information,
                    it accepts (path, prefix, merge) as args - if prefix is passed as 
                    non empty string merge will be discarded (even if set to True)
        *   upd:    merge() - added 'with_prefix' argumet, read DOC for more information,
        *   upd:    save() saves both source and properties,
        *   fix:    save() does not cause 'origins' link to 'working copies',
        *   new:    srcorigin variable for securing source (in 0.1.1 only properties were secure)
        *   upd/
            fix:    store() does not save the same property multiple times after adding new source
                    eg. with melt() or join().
                    (this filtering functionality should be placed in melt() and join() methods to 
                    avoid bloating self.source and self.srcorigin; 
                    eventually filtering can be implemented in save() method)
        *   new:    rsave() "reverse save" - moves origins to working copies,
        *   new:    added functionality to guess property types (str, int, float) and convert them,
                    (typecast() and typecasts() methods), read DOC for more,
