Release 0.1.3

        This release brings two new methods. Both are connected with working with 
    properties grouped in 'sections'.
        What's more - update in store() method which will cause your properties to 
    be saved in more human-readable form if the source is empty. For example when 
    properties are created from the inside of a program and not loaded to it.
        And last but not least - loading directories as properties. 
        In this case I suggest reading manual for more information about how 
    directories are treated. 
        Also, manual contains new files: 'groups.txt' and 'singles.txt' which are 
    describing how grouping is implemented.

        I hope you will enjoy this release as much as I do.
