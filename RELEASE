Release 0.1.3

        This release brings two new methods. Both are connected with working with 
    properties grouped in 'sections'.
        What's more - update in store() method which will cause your properties to 
    be saved in more human-readable form if the source is empty. For example when 
    properties are created from the inside of a program and not loaded to it.
        And last but not least - loading directories as properties. 
        In this case I suggest reading manual for more information about how 
    directories are treated. 
        Also, manual contains new files: 'groups.txt' and 'singles.txt' which are 
    describing how grouping is implemented.

        I hope you will enjoy this release as much as I do.

    *   y fix(es),
    *   z new feature(s).

    ->  pyproperties.py
        !   upd:    getkeyof() method was renamed to getkeysof() - simply because several 
                    keys can have the same value;
        *   upd:    store() uses grouping for storing properties created from blank;
        *   upd/
            fix:    gets(), sets(), removes() and pops() are now basing on different regular 
                    expression; 
                    also, before compiling to pattern, every dot '.' is escaped to '\.';
        *   fix:    creating blank Properties object will be able to work with,
                    thanks to the new blank() method;
        *   new:    blank() methode creating blank properties
                    can be used to erase all properties and source of loaded properties;
        *   new:    getgroups() method which returns list of properties groups found 
                    in internal dictionary, read DOC for more;
        *   new:    getsingles() method which returns list of properties which do not 
                    belong to any group, read DOC for more;
        *   new:    loading directories as properties, read manual for more;
        *   new:    StoreError and LoadError added, read DOC for more;
        *   new:    getre() which is another getter - this one allows you to get properties 
                    by passing a pattern (compiled or as a string);
