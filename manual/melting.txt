MELTING PROPERTIES.

        melt() method does one thing: it tries to makes foo as similar 
    to bar as possible. It does it by:
        *   completing foo with bar's properties,
        *   and then merging foo's properties with the ones bar have,
        *   joining bar's source to foo's source,

        To save this changes you need to call save().
