SETTERS or HOW TO SET A PROPERTY.

        pyproperties has two setter methods.


    1.  set()

            Is used to set single properties eg. ('customer.0.name', 'Agent Smith').


    2.  sets()

            Is desinged to be used when you need to set values for group of 
        properties eg. 'customer.*.name'.

            Before compiling regular exression pattern every '*' is replaced 
        by '[a-zA-Z0-9_.]*' string; every '.' (which has a 
        special meaning in regular expressions) is escaped and '^' is insrted 
        on the begining and '$' at the end of the pattern. Then, pattern is 
        compiled.

            sets() creates a sorted list of all keys matching given pattern. 
        Then, it assigns first given value to first key on a list. 
            If there are more keys then values last value is added to any key 
        above the number of values given.
            In case keyworded values were passed sets() will check for key in 
        kwargs before taking value from args list. If the key is in kwargs 
        value counter is not increased.
            This loop is continued for all keys that matched given pattern.
