HOW TO LOAD PROPERTIES FILE.

        There are two ways of doing so.

        First - you just call a class with path asa an argument:
            foo = pyproperties.Properties( path )

        And second - you call a class with no argument an later call read() 
    method with path as an argument.
            foo = pyproperties.Properties()
            foo.read( path )

        The second method can be useful when you know that you will need some 
    properites object but the path is not yet unknown.

    ####

        Loading properites results in creation of several variables:
            *   path = path pointing to loaded .properites file,
            *   name = name of the file,
            *   source = source of file,
            *   propsorigin = original dict of properties,
            *   properties = dict that you are working with,
