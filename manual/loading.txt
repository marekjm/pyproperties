HOW TO LOAD PROPERTIES FILE.

        There are two ways of doing so.

        First - you just call a class with path asa an argument:
            foo = pyproperties.Properties( path )

        And second - you call a class with no argument an later call read() 
    method with path as an argument.
            foo = pyproperties.Properties()
            foo.read( path )

        The second method can be useful when you know that you will need some 
    properites object but the path is unknown at the moment.

        Loading style:

        [LINE]              [LOADED KEY/VALUE]

        'key = value'       'key' / 'value'
        'key= value '       'key' / 'value '
        'key = value '      'key' / 'value '
        'key : value '      'key' / 'value'

        White space preceding and trailing the key are both stripped. 
    White space preceding value are stripped but the trailing are preserved.
    You can preserve preceding whitespace of the value by escaping first 
    whitescape of it's value.

        [LINE]              [LOADED KEY/VALUE]

        'key =\  value '       'key' / '  value '
