JOINING MULTIPLE PROPERTIES FILES.

        pyproperties allows you to join several *.properties files together. 
    When the join() method is called it follows this steps:

        *   create new properties instance from 'path',
        -   get name of newly loaded properties,
        *   if properties cannot be loaded nothing will be done but IOError 
            is silenced (notification is printed to stdout, this can change during alpha stage),
        *   complete the properties,
        *   join source,

        Join does not merge properties! 
    If you want unctionality of completing and merging use melt() mothod instead (but it does not 
    accept prefixes).
