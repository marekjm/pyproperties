MERGING PROPERTIES.

        pyproperties allows you to merge several properties objects. 
    When you call 'foo.merge( bar )' value of every property found 
    in bar and in foo is copied from bar to foo. 
        If some property is not found in foo but exists in bar - it 
    is not created in foo.
