REGULAR EXPRESSIONS USED IN PYPROPERTIES.

        Regular expressions are used in pyproperties in 
    methods working with groups of properties:
        *   gets()
        *   sets()
        *   removes()
        *   pops()
        ~   getgroups()
        ~   getsingles()

    and with type guessing:
        *   __tcast__()
        *   __tcasts__()


        The first four (gets, sets, removes and pops) are based on the same 
    pattern. When you pass identifier of the property as a string it's being 
    transformed in such way:

            'customer.*.name'   ->  '^cusomer\.[a-z0-9_.]*\.name$'

        Every '*' character in identifier is replaced and every '.' in identifier 
    is escaped.

        '*'     ->  '[a-z0-9_\.]*'
        '.'     ->  '\.'

    ----------------

        Regular expressions in type guessing:

        *   guessing 'int':     '^[0-9]+$'
        *   guessing float':    '^[0-9]+$'

        If neither of them is matched type of the property is considered 'str'.

    ----------------

        There are four three regular expressions used by pyproperties:

            wildcart_re = "[a-z0-9_.]*"
            guess_int_re = "^[0-9]+$"
            guess_float_re = "^[0-9]*\.[0-9]+$"
