COMMENTING PROPERTIES.


        When reading from file both ! and # characters are considered "comments", but 
    when using store() method all !-comments will be converted to #-comments.

        This is done so because of the thirteenth line of The Zen of Python:
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."

----

    With pyproperties it is possible to manipulate (add/remove) comments "of" or "from" properties.
We need to specify meaning of the actions:
* to _remove comment_ of the property means that we are removing comment _attached to_ this property,
* to _uncomment_ property means to remove comment _from this_ property,


        SOURCE:
        #   this is s comment
        this.is.a=value
        
        >>> props.rmcomment("this.is.a")
        
        SOURCE:
        this.is.a=value

        SOURCE:
        #some=value
        
        >>> props.uncomment("some")
        
        SOURCE:
        some=value
