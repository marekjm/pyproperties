COMMENTING PROPERTIES.


        When reading from file both ! and # characters are considered "comments", but 
    when using store() method all !-comments will be converted to #-comments.

        This is done so because of the thirteenth line of The Zen of Python:
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
