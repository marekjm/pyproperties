HOW TO STORE PROPERTIES.

        There is a special method for storing loaded properites: store()
    When you want to write yor properites to a file you should call 
    store() with path to the file you want your properties to be saved in. 

    WARNING!
        Storing can be a little tricky at the beginning, because when you are 
    performing any operation on you object eg. removing some property it 
    is only removed from self.properties dict, but when you call store() it 
    takes values from self.propsorigin dict. 
        This is done to prevent unwanted or accidental damage to your data. 
    When you are sure that you did everything right and want to store your 
    new, great properties you should do like this:

        foo.save()
        foo.store( "./foo.properties" )

        Because if you will do just:

        foo.store( "./foo.properties" )

    it will just write original properties to the file.
