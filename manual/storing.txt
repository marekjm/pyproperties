HOW TO STORE PROPERTIES.

        There is a special method for storing loaded properites: store()
    When you want to write yor properites to a file you should call 
    store() with path to the file you want your properties to be saved in. 

    WARNING!
        Storing can be a little tricky at the beginning, because when you are 
    performing any operation on you object eg. removing some property it 
    is only removed from self.properties dict, but when you call store() it 
    takes values from self.propsorigin dict. 
        This is done to prevent unwanted or accidental damage to your data. 
    When you are sure that you did everything right and want to store your 
    new, great properties you should do like this:

        foo.save()
        foo.store( "./foo.properties" )

    Because if you will do just:

        foo.store( "./foo.properties" )

    with any unsaved changes pyproperties will raise UnsavedChangesError.

    ----------------

        You can store properties with unsaved changes by passing optional 
    'force' argument as True. This will prevent UnsavedChangesError from 
    being raised and store properties as of the state of last saving.

        >>> foo = pyproperties.Properties("./foo.properties")
        >>> foo.set("some.property", "some value")
        >>> foo.addcomment("some.property", "some comment\ndivided into\nseveral lines")
        >>> foo.store()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "./modules/pyproperties.py", line 480, in store
            if self.unsaved and not force: raise UnsavedChangesError("trying to store with unsaved changes")
        pyproperties.UnsavedChangesError: trying to store with unsaved changes
        >>>
        >>> foo.store(force=True)
        
    and pyproperties would happily store your props.

    ----------------

        From version 0.1.4 and above store() is divided into four submethods:
        *   _storesrc()
        *   _storegroups()
        *   _storesingles()
        *   _dump()
        By passing 'no_dump' argument as True to
    store() method you can tell it to only generate lines and use your custom function to write 
    them to file.

    ----------------

        Prior to version 0.1.2 if store() was used on properties with no source 
    they were stored as an ugly mess. From 0.1.2 and above properties created 
    from blank are stored in groups (thanks to the capability of grouping) and 
    properties which do not belong to any group are appended at the end. 
        A blank line is inserted between each group.
