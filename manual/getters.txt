GETTERS or HOW TO GET PROPERTIES.

        pyproperties comes with many handy getters. There are three 
    basic get-type methods: get, gets and getre. 
        They differ only slightly but are designed to do different things.


    1.  get()

            Is used to get single properties eg. 'customer.0.name'.
        It does not do anything more than that. 

            You can pass 'parse' argument as True if you want get() to 
        try to parse value before returning it.
            You can pass 'cast' argument as True if you want get() to 
        try to cast type of a property before returning its value.

            If both 'parse' and 'cast' are passed as True value is parsed 
        and then its type is casted if neccessary.


    2.  gets()

            Is designed to return groups of properties. It is achieved by 
        passing keys like this one: 'customer.*.name'.

            Before compiling regular exression pattern every '*' is replaced 
        by '[a-zA-Z0-9_.]*' string; every '.' (which has a 
        special meaning in regular expressions) is escaped and '^' is insrted 
        on the begining and '$' at the end of the pattern. Then, pattern is 
        compiled.

            Every property in properties dictionary which key will match 
        the pattern will be added to newly created dict. This dict will be 
        later returned by the gets() method.


    3.  getre()

            Its basicaly gets() but based on custom regular exression patterns. 
        You can pass any pattern to it - in form of a string, then it will be 
        compiled, or as a precompiled one. 
            getre() returns dict with properties which key matched the pattern.
