SAVING YOUR WORK.

        When you initialize new properites object you get two dictionaries of
    representing loaded file:
        *   one, which you are really working ->    self.properties,
        *   and secure one ->   self.propsorigin,

        Method named save() does very simple thing: it moves self.properties 
    (on which you are working) to self.propsorigin (which is the secured version).
    After saving, your changed properties become new origin and you can start 
    editing them once again. It's useful for saving your progress. 

        It's also important to call save() before storing edited properties 
    because if you will not call save(), store() method will use umodified 
    version of your properties.
