#### Release 0.2.3 of `pyproperties`

###### [Changelog](./Changelog.mdown), [Manual](./manual/index.mdown)


This release had slipped a little bit. But is pretty fruitful. 
Version `0.2.3` introduces further improvements in the `__include__` field. 

What is more - heavy refactoring. 
New class emerged from the base `Properties()` - `Reader()`. 
Responsibilities in `pyproperties` are now well defined: 
`Reader()` writes and parses the initial file, `Properties()` provides interface for working with loaded file and 
`Wrier()` stores the file after the job is finished.  
Also - several small methods were removed (`Properties()` is now slightly slimmer) or 
factored out as functions available directly from `pyproperties`. 

As always everything is in [Changelog](Changelog.mdown), [DOC](DOC) and [manuals](./manual/index.html)
