__```pyproperties``` is a library providing methods for working with ```*.properties``` files.__


THIS IS __NOT__ a ```java.util.Properties``` replacement for Python. 
If you look for this kind of solution go [here](https://bitbucket.org/jnoller/pyjavaproperties/src/6dc1f59f6793/pyjavaproperties.py).

```pyproperites``` aims to ease manipulation, interaction and use of ```*.properties``` files in Python 3.x programs
by providing getters, setters and methods like ```merge()```, ```complete()```, ```join()``` and ```store()```.

Since version 0.1.4 ```pyproperties``` is considering specification described [here](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html) 
as the one which ```pyproperties``` will try stick to.

__HOW TO__

Manuals are placed in ```manual``` directory in every released package.  
Since version ```0.1.6``` they are in the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format. If you do not have any viewer (I did not find any myself) you can install an 
[addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer/) for Firefox and view Markdown files in nice, formatted way.
