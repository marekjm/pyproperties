__```pyproperties``` is a library providing methods for working with ```*.properties``` files.__


THIS IS __NOT__ a ```java.util.Properties``` replacement for Python. 
If you look for this kind of solution go [here](https://bitbucket.org/jnoller/pyjavaproperties/src/6dc1f59f6793/pyjavaproperties.py).

```pyproperites``` aims to ease manipulation, interaction and use of ```*.properties``` files in Python 3.x programs
by providing getters, setters and methods like ```merge()```, ```complete()```, ```join()``` and ```store()```.

Since version 0.1.4 is loosly trying to stick to the specification described [here](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html).
