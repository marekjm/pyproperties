Fetaures:

1.  add support for 'include' property as described on http://commons.apache.org/configuration/howto_properties.html

        'include=foo.properties' will be included as:
            foo.property.0=0
            foo.property.1=1

        to include without a prefix you should write it this way:
            include=(foo.properties)
            OR
            include=foo.properties --no-prefix

        to include with a specified prefix you should write it this way:
            include=foo.properties as bar
