****    How to

To use pyproperties library you only need file named 'pyproperties.py'. 
Place it in whatever directory you need.
Then you will have to 'import' it. I suggest using this line:

    >>> from pyproperties import Properties as properties

After that you can read properties with following method:

    >>> foo = properties( "/home/user/my/diretory/foo.properties" )

To get single property:

    >>> foo.get( "foo.bar" )
    
Or multiple properties:

    >>> foo.gets( "foo.*" )
